In this research, different image processing and enhancement algorithms have been applied to cervical cancer histopathology data to train and validate a custom-designed CNN model and a pre-trained ResNet50 model for classification.  Comparative analysis has been performed on the effectiveness of ROI extraction, color normalization, data augmentation, and class-imbalance reduction using synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) approach for classification of cervical cancer types from histopathology images.
